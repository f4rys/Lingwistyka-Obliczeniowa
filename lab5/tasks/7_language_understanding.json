      "response": "### Summary and Final Answer\n\nThe ambiguity in the sentence \"I saw her duck\" stems from the dual meaning of the word \"duck.\" Specifically:\n\n1. **Lexical Ambiguity**: The word \"duck\" can function as both a noun (referring to the bird) and a verb (meaning to lower one's head). This leads to two distinct interpretations:\n   - As a noun: \"I saw her duck\" could mean that you observed her pet or owned duck (the bird).\n   - As a verb: It could mean that you witnessed her performing the action of ducking (lowering her head).\n\n2. **Syntactic Structure**: The sentence can be parsed in two ways:\n   - If \"duck\" is a noun, then \"her duck\" forms the direct object.\n   - If \"duck\" is a verb, it acts as a bare infinitive following the direct object \"her,\" indicating an action she performed (i.e., she ducked).\n\nWithout additional context to disambiguate the meaning of \"duck,\" both interpretations remain valid.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is ambiguous because the word \"duck\" can be interpreted in two different ways within the same grammatical structure.\n\n**Final Output:**\nThe ambiguity arises from the word \"duck,\" which can mean either a bird (noun) or to lower one's head (verb), leading to two possible interpretations of the sentence. Specifically, it could imply seeing someone's pet duck or observing someone performing the action of ducking.\n\nThus, the output is:\n\n\\boxed{It could mean she lowered her head or that she owns a bird called a duck.}",
