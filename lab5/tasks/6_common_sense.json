The most common and immediate action in such a scenario is to take an umbrella to avoid getting wet.

      "response": "**Summary:**\nThe situation described involves seeing dark clouds and feeling raindrops. Dark clouds often precede heavier rainfall, and feeling drops indicates that precipitation has already started. In such scenarios, common sense dictates preparing against the rain to stay dry and comfortable. The most typical actions are bringing an umbrella or wearing a rain jacket, as these items protect against rain and are commonly used in everyday life when faced with unexpected rain showers.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate response is to bring an umbrella or wear a rain jacket.\n\n\\boxed{An\\ umbrella\\ or\\ a\\ rain\\ jacket}\n\nOutput: Bring an umbrella or wear a rain jacket.",
